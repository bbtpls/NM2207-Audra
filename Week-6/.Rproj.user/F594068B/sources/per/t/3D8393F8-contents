## Questions
<br>

#### Question-1: Countdown Blastoff (While Loop)

Create a program that simulates a rocket launch countdown using a while loop. Start from 10 and countdown to "Blastoff!" with a one-second delay between each countdown number. Print a message when the rocket launches.

**Hint:** You may want to use `cat` command to print the countdown and `Sys.sleep` for incorporating the delay

**Output preview:** Here is how the countdown could look like 

*removed images here for printing since images cannot be found on my laptop

**Solutions:**

```{r, eval=T,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
count <- 10
while (count >= 1) {
   cat(count, "...", "\n")
   count <- count - 1
   Sys.sleep(1)
   }
print("and...blastoff!")
```

#### Question-2: Word Reverser (for Loop)

Develop a program that takes a user-entered word and uses a while loop to print the word's characters in reverse order. For example, if the user enters "hello," the program should print "olleh."

**Hint:** You may want to use `substr` command to access each character of the input word, and `paste` command to join the reversed letters one at a time

**Solutions:** 

```{r, eval=T,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
reversi <- function(word){
  index <- nchar(word)
  reversed_word <-""
  while (index > 0){
    reversed_word <- paste(reversed_word, substr(word, index, index), sep = "")
    index <- index - 1
  }
  print(reversed_word)
}
reversi("heloooOo")
```
