## Self intro
I'm a Y3 CNM student who actually transferred from archi to CNM after just one semester at NUS. Because of that, I never got to go for CNM orientation and sometimes I still feel like I missed out, but thankfully I've slowly gathered friends from my other CNM modules over the past semesters.
